A collection of plugins for BuildStream that are related to containers.

How to use this repo
====================

There are two ways to use external buildstream plugins, either as a submodule, or as
a Python package.

Using the plugins locally within a project
------------------------------------------
To use the container plugins locally within a
`BuildStream <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream>`_
project, you will first need to clone the repo to a location **within your
project**::

    git clone https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/bst-plugins-container.git

The plugins must be declared in *project.conf*. To do this, please refer
to BuildStream's
`Local plugins documentation <https://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream/format_project.html#local-plugins>`_.

Using the plugins as a Python package
-------------------------------------
To use the container plugins as a Python package within a
`BuildStream <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream>`_
project, you will first need to install bst-plugins-container via pip::

    git clone https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/bst-plugins-container.git
    cd bst-plugins-container
    pip install --user -e .

To ensure it's installed, try: ``pip show bst-plugins-container``,
this should show information about the package.

.. note::
   The -e option ensures that changes made to the git repository are reflected
   in the Python package's behaviour.

Then, the plugins must be declared in the *project.conf*. The implementation of
this is explained in BuildStream's
`Pip plugins documentation <https://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream/format_project.html#pip-plugins>`_
